# Open Source Economy

Exploring decentralized payment ecosystems for open source technology and culture,  
with a "not-for-loss" license and incentives for transparent and consensual participation.

## Why

+ To help solve the problem of funding the open source ecosystem:  
  [World's Email Encryption Software Relies On One Guy Who Is Going Broke](http://www.propublica.org/article/the-worlds-email-encryption-software-relies-on-one-guy-who-is-going-broke)
+ To strengthen the open source ecosystem (increase quality, diversity, viability)
+ To create a virtuous circle of growth (simplify transition to profitability; reward enablers of this)
+ To accelerate human progress (reduce barriers to knowledge and tools)

## Challenges

- Aligning incentives for participation by individuals and companies
- Providing attractive reasons and simple ways to get started
- Automating payment based on profitability, usage, and subjective value
- Designing a reasonable system for distributing funds
- Bootstrapping at small scales requires finding early adopters
- Gaining adoption at large, useful scales requires advocacy

## Ideas

+ Not-for-loss licensing
+ Voluntary, transparent participation
+ Open reputations incentivising honest and accountable behavior
+ Identity established by communities and individuals you trust
+ Incentives for users, developers, students, professionals, and investors
+ Ethereum and smart contracts

## Use Cases

1. An open source developer and a professional user  
2. A creative commons author and an enthusiast student  
3. A DAO company and a foreign investor  
4. A respected mentor and a young apprentice  
5. An open architect and a DAO construction firm

## Case Study: Open developers + professional users

### Participants

1. **Open source developer**
  + Wants to release software that makes a difference in the world,  
    by achieving widespread use with minimal barriers
  + Wants to participate in a culture of open understanding and improvement  
    that allows unrestricted learning and modification  
  + Wants to receive payment to support their efforts,  
    in proportion to their usefulness to others
2. **Professional software user**
  + Wants to use simple and secure software that meets their real needs
  + Wants to be assured of the source and authenticity
  + Wants to have a voice in the future development
  + Wants to support other individuals and organizations,  
    to the extend that they empower him or herself

### Tools

1. **Not-for-loss license**  
   Grants unlimited commercial, non-profit, and personal use  
   to any organization or individual that agrees to share  
   a small amount (about 1%) of profits over a subscription period  
   with parts of the open ecosystem they value.
2. **Public Accounts**  
   A public address by which individuals and organizations can receive funds,  
   and redirect them to public or private recipients in a very flexible  
   but transparently auditable way.
3. **Valuation Measure**  
   A contract component that model the degree to which an individual values others,  
   as represented by pairs of relative weights and identifiers.
4. **Transaction Middleware**  
   Allows controlling the flow of transaction value with a combination of  
   standard components and custom parameters.
5. **Donation Contract**  
   A type of contract that allows sharing incoming funds with recipients  
   of one's choice in accordance with one's values.

### External Infrastructure

Probably outside of our scope for this project, but these systems are  
likely to arise in the future, and would be useful for an open economy:

1. **Open Identities and Reputation**  
   Allows users and organizations to build a solid history  
   which allows them to be trusted by others, in the context of communities  
   which both hold them accountable and provide opportunities  
   for future connections and benefits.
2. **Registries and Ratings Agencies**  
   Third party organizations that make it easier to identify and evaluate  
   market participants and services, including individuals, groups, and contracts.
