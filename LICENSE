Not-For-Loss License

The not-for-loss license grants unlimited commercial, non-profit, and
personal use to any organisation or individual that agrees to share a
small amount of profit (about 1%) with the parts of the open ecosystem
they value, in proportion to their benefit and use. By doing so, they
become members of this ecosystem and maintain their good standing.
